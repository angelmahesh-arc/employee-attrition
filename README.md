# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company, based on HR data. It uses common classification techniques to understand attrition patterns.

## 📋 Description
Using employee attributes like age, job role, salary, and work-life balance, the model classifies whether an employee is at risk of attrition.
